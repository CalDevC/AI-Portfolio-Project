The main ideas of our implementation were to closely follow the ideas presented in class and use the data structures and elements provided by the framework primarily to avoid jumping off into an area of unknowns in what is clearly a well-structured project. At the same time, we needed to be creative in developing heuristics and trying different approaches to solving these problems, so there was a lot of trial and error involved.

Corners problem heuristic:
Calculate the actual distance between the corners that have yet to be found and pacman's position and return the closest distance found.

Food heuristic:
Calculate the actual distance between the points in the food list and pacman's position and return the farthest distance found.

We worked together on all the problems, coding and debugging together for about 10 days everyday. We estimate that we put in around 70 hours between us including all of last weekend and whenever we were not in class or at work or compelled to meet a deadline for another class because we really wanted to give our best to this project.

We are quite happy with the outcome and hope you are too!

Thanks-
Chris and Chase
