# Please Note
The majority of this project was developed at UC Berkeley, primarily by John DeNero (denero@cs.berkeley.edu) and Dan Klein (klein@cs.berkeley.edu). Within this project were several blank sections that needed to be filled in to complete major parts of the project. The pieces of this project noted below were implemented by me were of my own design (excluding the traditional search algorithms, which I implemented but definitely did not create). These implementations include search algorithms, heuristics, and more.

The creators of this project requested that solutions not be shared or published, and I have attempted to honor this request by placing my solutions in this inconspicuously named repository. I have only made this repository public so that those who are reviewing my resume will be able to see my work. I am not attempting to give away any solutions. After receiving responses from the positions I have applied to this repository will be made private.
